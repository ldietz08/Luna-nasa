# Luna

Luna is catered towards lovers of astrophotography. A picture of the day web application that allows users to view a photo or video taken on a selected date.
Additionally, the app allows users to access an array of images of Mars taken by NASA's curiosity rover.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, React-Router, SASS.

Luna was one of the first projects I created to practice grabbing data from an api and displaying it to the user. It was initially created using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The data is provided by the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API and the MARS Rover photos API.
